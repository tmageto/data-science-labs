# <h2 id="list">Lists</h2>

# <h3 id="index">Indexing</h3>

# We are going to take a look at lists in Python. A list is a sequenced collection of different objects such as integers, strings, and other lists as well. The address of each element within a list is called an <b>index</b>. An index is used to access and refer to items within a list.

# <img src="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%202/Images/ListsIndex.png" width="1000" />

#  To create a list, type the list within square brackets <b>[ ]</b>, with your content inside the parenthesis and separated by commas. Letâ€™s try it!

# In[1]:


# Create a list

L = ["Michael Jackson", 10.1, 1982]
L


# We can use negative and regular indexing with a list :

# <img src="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%202/Images/ListsNeg.png" width="1000" />

# In[2]:


# Print the elements on each index

print('the same element using negative and positive indexing:\n Postive:',L[0],
'\n Negative:' , L[-3]  )
print('the same element using negative and positive indexing:\n Postive:',L[1],
'\n Negative:' , L[-2]  )
print('the same element using negative and positive indexing:\n Postive:',L[2],
'\n Negative:' , L[-1]  )


# <h3 id="content">List Content</h3>

# Lists can contain strings, floats, and integers. We can nest other lists, and we can also nest tuples and other data structures. The same indexing conventions apply for nesting:    
# 

# In[3]:


# Sample List

["Michael Jackson", 10.1, 1982, [1, 2], ("A", 1)]


# <h3 id="op">List Operations</h3>

#  We can also perform slicing in lists. For example, if we want the last two elements, we use the following command:

# In[4]:


# Sample List

L = ["Michael Jackson", 10.1,1982,"MJ",1]
L


# <img src="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%202/Images/ListsSlice.png" width="1000">

# In[5]:


# List slicing

L[3:5]


# We can use the method <code>extend</code> to add new elements to the list:

# In[6]:


# Use extend to add elements to list

L = [ "Michael Jackson", 10.2]
L.extend(['pop', 10])
L


# Another similar method is <code>append</code>. If we apply <code>append</code> instead of <code>extend</code>, we add one element to the list:

# In[7]:


# Use append to add elements to list

L = [ "Michael Jackson", 10.2]
L.append(['pop', 10])
L


#  Each time we apply a method, the list changes. If we apply <code>extend</code> we add two new elements to the list. The list <code>L</code> is then modified by adding two new elements:

# In[8]:


# Use extend to add elements to list

L = [ "Michael Jackson", 10.2]
L.extend(['pop', 10])
L


# If we append the list  <code>['a','b']</code> we have one new element consisting of a nested list:

# In[9]:


# Use append to add elements to list

L.append(['a','b'])
L


# As lists are mutable, we can change them. For example, we can change the first element as follows:

# In[10]:


# Change the element based on the index

A = ["disco", 10, 1.2]
print('Before change:', A)
A[0] = 'hard rock'
print('After change:', A)


#  We can also delete an element of a list using the <code>del</code> command:

# In[11]:


# Delete the element based on the index

print('Before change:', A)
del(A[0])
print('After change:', A)


# We can convert a string to a list using <code>split</code>.  For example, the method <code>split</code> translates every group of characters separated by a space into an element in a list:

# In[12]:


# Split the string, default is by space

'hard rock'.split()


# We can use the split function to separate strings on a specific character. We pass the character we would like to split on into the argument, which in this case is a comma.  The result is a list, and each element corresponds to a set of characters that have been separated by a comma: 

# In[13]:


# Split the string by comma

'A,B,C,D'.split(',')


# <h3 id="co">Copy and Clone List</h3>

# When we set one variable <b>B</b> equal to <b>A</b>; both <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are referencing the same list in memory:

# In[14]:


# Copy (copy by reference) the list A

A = ["hard rock", 10, 1.2]
B = A
print('A:', A)
print('B:', B)


# <img src="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%202/Images/ListsRef.png" width="1000" align="center">

# Initially, the value of the first element in <b>B</b> is set as hard rock. If we change the first element in <b>A</b> to <b>banana</b>, we get an unexpected side effect.  As <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are referencing the same list, if we change list <b>A</b>, then list <b>B</b> also changes. If we check the first element of <b>B</b> we get banana instead of hard rock:

# In[15]:


# Examine the copy by reference

print('B[0]:', B[0])
A[0] = "banana"
print('B[0]:', B[0])


# This is demonstrated in the following figure: 

# <img src = "https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%202/Images/ListsRefGif.gif" width="1000" />

# You can clone list  **A** by using  the following syntax:

# In[16]:


# Clone (clone by value) the list A

B = A[:]
B


#  Variable **B** references a new copy or clone of the original list; this is demonstrated in the following figure:

# <img src="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%202/Images/ListsVal.gif" width="1000" />

# Now if you change <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> will not change: 

# In[17]:


print('B[0]:', B[0])
A[0] = "hard rock"
print('B[0]:', B[0])
