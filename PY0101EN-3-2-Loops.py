# <h2 id="loop">Loops</h2>

# <h3 id="range">Range</h3>

# Sometimes, you might want to repeat a given operation many times. Repeated executions like this are performed by <b>loops</b>. We will look at two types of loops, <code>for</code> loops and <code>while</code> loops.
# 
# Before we discuss loops lets discuss the <code>range</code> object. It is helpful to think of the range object as an ordered list. For now, let's look at the simplest case. If we would like to generate a sequence that contains three elements ordered from 0 to 2 we simply use the following command:

# In[1]:


# Use the range

range(3)


# <img src="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%203/Images/LoopsRange.png" width="300" />

# <h3 id="for">What is <code>for</code> loop?</h3>

# The <code>for</code> loop enables you to execute a code block multiple times. For example, you would use this if you would like to print out every element in a list.    
# Let's try to use a <code>for</code> loop to print all the years presented in the list <code>dates</code>:

# This can be done as follows:

# In[2]:


# For loop example

dates = [1982,1980,1973]
N = len(dates)

for i in range(N):
    print(dates[i])     


# The code in the indent is executed <code>N</code> times, each time the value of <code>i</code> is increased by 1 for every execution. The statement executed is to <code>print</code> out the value in the list at index <code>i</code> as shown here:

# <img src="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%203/Images/LoopsForRange.gif" width="800" />

# In this example we can print out a sequence of numbers from 0 to 7:

# In[3]:


# Example of for loop

for i in range(0, 8):
    print(i)


# In Python we can directly access the elements in the list as follows: 

# In[4]:


# Exmaple of for loop, loop through list

for year in dates:  
    print(year)   


# For each iteration, the value of the variable <code>years</code> behaves like the value of <code>dates[i]</code> in the  first example:

# <img src="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%203/Images/LoopsForList.gif" width="800">

# We can change the elements in a list:

# In[5]:


# Use for loop to change the elements in list

squares = ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']

for i in range(0, 5):
    print("Before square ", i, 'is',  squares[i])
    squares[i] = 'weight'
    print("After square ", i, 'is',  squares[i])


#  We can access the index and the elements of a list as follows: 

# In[6]:


# Loop through the list and iterate on both index and element value

squares=['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']

for i, square in enumerate(squares):
    print(i, square)


# <h3 id="while">What is <code>while</code> loop?</h3>

# As you can see, the <code>for</code> loop is used for a controlled flow of repetition. However, what if we don't know when we want to stop the loop? What if we want to keep executing a code block until a certain condition is met? The <code>while</code> loop exists as a tool for repeated execution based on a condition. The code block will keep being executed until the given logical condition returns a **False** boolean value.
# 

# Letâ€™s say we would like to iterate through list <code>dates</code> and stop at the year 1973, then print out the number of iterations. This can be done with the following block of code:

# In[7]:


# While Loop Example

dates = [1982, 1980, 1973, 2000]

i = 0
year = 0

while(year != 1973):
    year = dates[i]
    i = i + 1
    print(year)

print("It took ", i ,"repetitions to get out of loop.")


# A while loop iterates merely until the condition in the argument is not  met, as shown in the following figure:
